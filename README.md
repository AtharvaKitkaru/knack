## Problem Statement:
Music is known to be effective for mood improvement. It has the power to change ones overall frame of mind. Music also plays a very big role in changing the atmosphere and influencing the ambience of any place. Seeing how much of a great impact music has on everyoneâ€™s lives we need a stable service to fulfil a few requirements that would make listening to music a better experience.
## Our Solution:
A blockchain-based decentralized music streaming platform to connect music enthusiasts directly to independent music artists.
